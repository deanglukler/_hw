# Translation
You’ll need to find the keys in the view, then lookup those keys in the specific YAML file in `/config/locales/en/your_class_or_view.yml`.
Once you’ve set your string, run `rake weblate:combine_yaml` in your console.
If you are replacing a bad translation, then you may need to goto the `es` or `fr` compiled file and change it there.
