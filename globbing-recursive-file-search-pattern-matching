*
Matches any string, including the null string.

?
Matches any character.


x|y

Matches either x or y. This operator has lower precedence than any other. 
The ‘|’ character must be within parentheses, to avoid interpretation as a pipeline. The alternatives are tried in order from left to right.





# Recursive

A pathname component of the form ‘(foo/)#’ matches a path consisting of zero or more directories matching the pattern foo.

As a shorthand, ‘**/’ is equivalent to ‘(*/)#’; note that this therefore matches files in the current directory as well as subdirectories. Thus:

ls (*/)#bar

or

ls **/bar

does a recursive directory search for files named ‘bar’ (potentially including the file ‘bar’ in the current directory). 

This form does not follow symbolic links; the alternative form ‘***/’ does, but is otherwise identical. 

Neither of these can be combined with other forms of globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the ‘*’ operators revert to their usual effect.

Even shorter forms are available when the option GLOB_STAR_SHORT is set. In that case if no / immediately follows a ** or *** they are treated as if both a / plus a further * are present. Hence:

setopt GLOBSTARSHORT
ls **.c

is equivalent to

ls **/*.c
