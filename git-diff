// All the changes (staged or not staged) will be shown

git diff HEAD file

// How does my branch differ from master?

git diff master..


// or to see all differences

git diff head~3 | code -


// ---

// just files names that have changes in them

git diff --name-status master..branchName


// ---

Only show the names of the files that have changed
git diff --name-only master..


// --

// If you want to see what you haven't git added yet:

git diff myfile.txt

//or if you want to see already-added changes

git diff --cached myfile.txt


// ---

// diff between master and myfile.txt

git diff master^^ myfile.txt


// ---

git diff branch_1..branch_2

That will produce the diff between the tips of the two branches. If you'd prefer to find the diff from their common ancestor to test, you can use three dots instead of two:

git diff branch_1...branch_2
