# Routes vs Endpoints

For example, with the URL http://example.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/123:

    The “route” is wp/v2/posts/123 – The route doesn’t include wp-json because wp-json is the base path for the API itself.
    This route has 3 endpoints:
        GET triggers a get_item method, returning the post data to the client.
        PUT triggers an update_item method, taking the data to update, and returning the updated post data.
        DELETE triggers a delete_item method, returning the now-deleted post data to the client.


On sites without pretty permalinks, the route is instead added to the URL as the rest_route parameter. For the above example, the full URL would then be http://example.com/?rest_route=/wp/v2/posts/123

ex http://localhost:8000/?rest_route=/wp/v2/music

# Choosing your permalink structure

In the Settings → Permalinks screen, you can choose one of the more common permalink structures or enter your own in the "Custom structure" field using the structure tags.
