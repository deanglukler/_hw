// rebase against own branch

git rebase --interactive HEAD~7


// NOTE: if you have issues pushing after it's because 
// the rebase rewrites commits and then the remote will appear to have 
// other commits
// use: 
ggpush --force-with-lease

// or if you're sure noone else has touched that branch:
ggpush --force 



// rebase all the commits between another branch and the current branch state

git rebase --interactive other_branch_name
