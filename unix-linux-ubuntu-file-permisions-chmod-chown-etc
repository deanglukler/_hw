u = user who owns
g = other users in the file's group
o = other users not in the file's group
a = all users

'=' means affect a right

d = directory (if element is a directory)
l = link (if element is a file link)
r = read (read permissions)
w = write (write permissions)
x = eXecute (only useful for scripts and programs)

ex --> chmod g+w someFile.txt


-- setfacl - set file access control lists



-- maintain group ownership
-- setgid (allows for files created in a dir to retain their parents ownership, whoever writes it..)
// set the setgid bit on every directory in dir..
sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod g+s {} \;

// i think this might do the same
sudo chmod -R g+s cake
