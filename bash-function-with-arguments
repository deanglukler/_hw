Two ways to call a function in bash..

function function_name {
   command...
}

or

function_name () {
   command...
}

To call a function with arguments:

function_name "$arg1" "$arg2"

The function refers to passed arguments by their position (not by name), that is $1, $2, and so forth. $0 is the name of the script itself.

Example:

function_name () {
   echo "Parameter #1 is $1"
}

Also, you need to call your function after it is declared.

#!/usr/bin/env sh

foo 1  # this will fail because foo has not been declared yet.

foo() {
    echo "Parameter #1 is $1"
}

foo 2 # this will work.

Output:

./myScript.sh: line 2: foo: command not found
Parameter #1 is 2
